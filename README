# MyAuth - Backend
**A self-study project to learn Go Lang, Microservices Architecture and Relational Databases.**

The idea of the project is to create a simple service for authenticating users using a combo of "username + password" and returning a valid JWT.

## The Architectural Design

We are using 2 endpoints for checking if the "email + password" is valid and another to check if the received JWT is valid:

*- [POST] /login*

*- [GET] /auth*

## Code Complexity

Oh yes, in this code you are going to see some Big-O notations, because I want to also practice asymptotic analysis.
